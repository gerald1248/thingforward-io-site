<h3>Letâ€™s do things right. </h3>
<p>Everybody knows that IoT is the next big thing. But has anybody ever tried to build things?
</p>
<p>
When we started working on IoT in 2014, we felt like we were being thrown back into the dark ages of software design. Devices are handcrafted by the high priests of native C who are highly secretive about their design plans. An uncountable number of so called standards are being used to protect existing claims. Unfortunately, security is widely neglected. Quality is left to chance.. Agility is a foreign word. The bottom line is that the technical advances of at least 20 years of Internet are basically ignored in IoT software development.

</p>
<p>
ThingForward is our attempt to improve software development for IoT. We want to build things and services that are simpler, faster, better and easier to maintain. We want to be open and transparent. We want to create direct value for professional IoT software developers. We welcome your contribution.

</p>
<p>
Since we believe that value is often generated by the small details, we decided to define and work on projects covering specific IoT aspects. You are already looking at our first project, which is the
 <a href="/blog.html">&rarr; ThingForward blog</a>.
We will use it to share our experiences with you. Hopefully, preventing you from making some of the mistakes we have already made. Please feel free to comment on our posts or to suggest improvements. We know that we are far away from something fancy. But we are making the first step forward.
